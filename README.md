# obstacle-detection

### Setting Up
Make sure you have npm and node installed

```
npm install
gulp build
npm start
```
It will be hosted on localhost:8080

### Development
`gulp watch` will watch js and scss files and re-compile them when they change.

`nodemon app.js` will boot up the server with nodemon, which will automatically restart the server when it detects a file change.
